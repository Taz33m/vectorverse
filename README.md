# üß© Vectorverse - An Educational Physics Sandbox

An interactive, visual C++ application designed to help students learn fundamental physics concepts through real-time simulation and experimentation. Can also be used to learn intermediate C++.

## üéØ Overview

VectorVerse is an educational physics simulation engine that allows users to:
- Observe and manipulate physical systems interactively
- Visualize forces, velocities, and energy in real-time
- Compare different numerical integration methods
- Experiment with Newton's laws, collisions, and energy conservation

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Simulation
- **2D Physics Engine**: Real-time simulation with adjustable speed
- **Multiple Bodies**: Support for circles with mass, velocity, and forces
- **Force Models**: 
  - Gravity (toggleable)
  - Friction and air resistance
  - Custom user-defined forces

### Physics Capabilities
- **Newtonian Motion**: F = ma
- **Integration Methods**: Euler, Semi-Implicit Euler, Verlet
- **Collision Response**: Elastic and inelastic collisions
- **Energy Tracking**: Real-time kinetic, potential, and total energy graphs

### Visualization
- Real-time display of force and velocity vectors
- Object trajectories and trails
- Energy graphs over time
- Adjustable visual settings

### Educational Modules
1. **Sandbox Mode**: Free experimentation
2. **Projectile Motion**: Parabolic trajectory visualization
3. **Elastic Collisions**: Momentum conservation demonstration
4. **Harmonic Motion**: Oscillation and energy exchange
5. **Inclined Plane**: Friction and normal forces

## üéÆ Controls

### Keyboard
